# FreaksLabor
An interactive social-media app, that is supposed to motivate people to meet new friends and more. 
It works with Bluetooth LE, which scans the surroundings anonymously and notifys you,
if it finds marked friends of you or new people, 
that have the same interests as you.

```markdown
# How it works
FreaksLabor searches for other devices with Google Nearby API, 
which uses Bluetooth and Wifi
and talks to them with a always random name and encrypted messages, 
so spoofing or decrypting is impossible!
