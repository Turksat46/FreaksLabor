    <string name="description">An interactive social-media app, that is supposed to motivate people
    to meet new friends and more. It works with Bluetooth LE, which scans the surroundings anonymously
    and notifys you, if it finds marked friends of you or new people, that have the same interests
    as you. So, if you want to enter a new adventure, let\'s start it!</string>
    <string name="askforpermission">Please accept and allow some necessary permissions and let\'s start immediately! Don\'t worry, this app can work
    without internet and does not send any data to any server, if you don\'t want it to! We only
    save data to Firebase, a cloud-solution provided by Google, such as friends, time spend with
    them and more. But, it will short out the functionality! A more precise list of data, that is collected and saved online can be found on the
    official Github!</string>
    <string name="supporttext">If you need help or have some questions, feel free to contact me through E-Mail. Or if you are feeling lucky and you want to support the work, feel free to buy me a coffee instead :D</string>
