# Introduction into the Engines
FreaksLabor works with Bluetooth LE and the Beacons-Technology, 
which identifies devices, that are near you and shows them to you. 
```
### Beacons close up
How beacons work is simple. A device with FreaksLabor on it or user, to make it simple, 
starts transmitting a beacon off of the device, 
which is like WI-FI or radio, and any user, that has FreaksLabor on their device can see this beacon and connect to it. 
These beacons have a, what's called an UUID, which is a simple id, so that only FreaksLabor can recognize and use it.
